# Frontend

This is the frontend of the Sprint 8 project of It Academy. You can find the backend of the project [here](https://github.com/guifreribas/backend).
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installing

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. You must create a environment file inside the `src` folder.

```sh
ng g environments
```

4. You must add your Mapbox key in the environment files:

```sh
mapboxKey: YOUR_MAPBOX_KEY
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `pnpm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
